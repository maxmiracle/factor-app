Vladimir Putin has flown to Volgograd, the scene of two suicide bomb attacks that killed 34 people, to meet victims and pay tribute to those who died.  Putin met local and federal officials to discuss the security situation. In a televised speech he said: "The heinousness of the crime committed here in Volgograd needs no additional comments. "No matter what motivates the criminals, there is no justification for the killing of civilians, especially women and children." He stressed that Russian forces "do their utmost to protect women and children during their operations". The first attack took place at Volgograd's busy main railway station on Sunday. The second bomb was detonated on a crowded trolleybus during the morning rush hour on Monday.
